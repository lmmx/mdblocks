# mdblocks

Markdown code block generation convenience functions:

- `btickblock` for generic `STDOUT` blocks
- `pybtickblock` for Python commands and their `STDOUT` and/or `STDERR` blocks
- `shbtickblock` for shell commands and their `STDOUT` and/or `STDERR` blocks

For quickly generating reproducible code examples in documentation (READMEs etc.).
This README contains examples of their usage and resulting markdown output.

## Installation

If you don't already have a bashrc dotfiles directory, here's how to make one
and then "install" these 3 functions (i.e. make them available in your shell
environment).

```sh
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles/bashrc/`
cp bashrc_mdblock_functions.sh ~/dotfiles/bashrc/`
echo "source ~/dotfiles/bashrc/bashrc_mdblock_functions.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Personally I have the line `source ~/dotfiles/bashrc/bashrc_functions` in my `~/.bashrc`
and then that starts with the following block:

```sh
for bashrc_funcs_file in ~/dotfiles/bashrc/bashrc_functions_*; do
  source $bashrc_funcs_file;
done
```

You can append the file directly to your bashrc but that's not advisable.
Your `.bashrc` should be kept small (only the most important things) and
complexity stored elsewhere (ideally in categorised files, e.g. this file is
categorised as `_functions_md` where 'md' means 'markdown').

## Dependencies

- `xclip` copies the result to the clipboard (result will not print to TTY if this operation fails)
  - To remove dependency, edit the last line of the functions to only print to TTY
- `bash`
  - Other shells should be compatible
- `grep`
  - See [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/430182/89254) for details of the
    requirements for the `grep` pipe buffer handling (done to avoid executing the
    command multiple times for each of `STDOUT` and `STDERR`)

## Examples

It seems it's not possible to nest these programs together (presumably as the process substitution
will use the same process names or numbers, etc., and this will lead to one becoming overridden and
subsequently its pipe freezing, and no output).

The good news is this means that to show all the functions I will demonstrate them in more than one
way.

The sections below go through examples with `btickblock`, `shbtickblock`, and `pybtickblock`.
- `btickblock` puts the contents of any file into a single backtick block
- `shbtickblock` executes a shell script and collates its standard output and/or error
- `pytickblock` executes a Python program and collates its standard output and/or error

All of these can be customised using `--noclip` (to prevent the results being sent to the clipboard)
and `--plain` (to prevent the first block being annotated, i.e. to prevent syntax highlighting
in markdown viewers)

`btickblock` can be customised using `--py` and `--sh` to change the backtick block annotation to
"py" and "sh" (i.e. to get only the file block rather than the output blocks the other commands give).

### Shell program demo

#### `btickblock`

Given a simple shell script, `btickblock` prints its code (`cat` to a variable and `echo`, no big deal)

- The command run here is `btickblock test_out.sh --sh` which changes the backtick annotation to
  "sh" rather than "STDOUT".

```sh
printf "hello"
printf "..."
echo "world"
```

The markdown block you can see above (which will probably be coloured by a syntax highlighter)
was generated by the command above.

I can achieve the exact same result with text input from a pipe, permitted because the
`btickblock` function gets its input via a command-substituted `cat "$1"` call (to
[trim trailing newlines](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/17747/why-does-shell-command-substitution-gobble-up-a-trailing-newline-char)
and standardise files without an EOF newline), and so if we pass the filename as `-`
then `cat` reads STDIN over a pipe.

- The command run here is `cat test_out.sh | btickblock - --sh`

```sh
printf "hello"
printf "..."
echo "world"
```

That's a trivial example: more realistically, perhaps I want to use `awk` to prepend line
numbers to my file (the awk `NR` variable stores each line number)

- The command run here is `awk '{print NR ": " $0}' test_out.sh | btickblock - --sh`

```sh
1: printf "hello"
2: printf "..."
3: echo "world"
```

This isn't validly annotated as shell script with those line numbers though, so I can remove them
with the `--plain` flag

- The command run here is `awk '{print NR ": " $0}' test_out.sh | btickblock - --plain`

```
1: printf "hello"
2: printf "..."
3: echo "world"
```

You might wish to make a `.bashrc` alias for `btickblock - --plain` (something easily tab-autocompleted)
if you find yourself using it a lot, so you can just pipe to that alias.

The other feature (which I can't demo the effect of) is that passing `--noclip` will prevent the results from
being copied to `xclip`'s clipboard.

#### `shbtickblock`

The following is an example of the output of `shbtickblock`, obtaining the output of the file we previously only
obtained the file contents of, `test_out.sh`.

- The command run here is `shbtickblock test_out.sh`

```sh
printf "hello"
printf "..."
echo "world"
```
⇣
```STDOUT
hello...world
```

At the time of writing, you can't execute a shell script passed in over the STDIN pipe, and results in
an empty STDOUT block. (This feature is on the TODO list, the final section of this README).

- E.g. `cat test_out.sh | shbtickblock -`

```sh
printf "hello"
printf "..."
echo "world"
```
⇣
```STDOUT
```

Instead, you can use `btickblock` twice with the STDIN pipe input and `--noclip` then collect at the
end, usually using `()` (subshell
[grouping commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Grouping)).

For example, let's modify `test_out.sh` to print "hella" instead of "hello", using `sed`.

- The commands to run here are the following (I'll write this markdown block by hand this time):
  - ...making sure not to `echo -e` the `blockstring` variable in case it contains non-linebreak
    newlines (which would become expanded, i.e. ending the line midway), and `echo`ing twice because
    `xclip` gobbles up the STDOUT stream when it saves to clipboard.

```sh
blockstring=$(
  sed 's/hello/hella/' test_out.sh | btickblock - --noclip --sh
  echo "⇣"
  sed 's/hello/hella/' test_out.sh | bash | btickblock - --noclip
)
echo "$blockstring" | xclip -sel clip
echo "$blockstring"
```

- ...and that command gives the following desired report of the input and output block:

```sh
printf "hella"
printf "..."
echo "world"
```
```STDOUT
hella...world
```

(I will try and work this into the `shbtickblock` function, TBC)

### Python program demo

#### `pybtickblock`

The following script will demonstrate `pybtickblock`, and to display it in this README
I used the `btickblock` command (introduced above).

- The command run here is `btickblock demo_test.sh --sh`

```sh
source bashrc_mdblock_functions.sh

echo "--> Testing test_out.py"
pybtickblock test_out.py
```

To run this script, I just use `bash` (or you can `chmod +x` it to run with `./`)

- The command run here is `bash demo_test.sh`

```py
print(1)
```
⇣
```STDOUT
1
```

A more useful but more complex version of the above command for a single test, is
scripted in the file `bash demo_py_tests.sh`, which loops over all the Python test files
to demonstrate the output of `pybtickblock`. (This was useful when developing it to check
the output for all combinations of STDOUT and/or STDERR, in cases of failure/success etc.)

> (The output from this next command is very long so I delimit it with a vertical break,
> `---` in markdown, before and after)

- The command run here is `bash demo_tests.sh`

## TODO

- [x] Shell script execution as for Python
- [ ] Shell command execution, i.e. treat 'here documents'(?) (or however you call file literals
      piped over STDIN) the same as actual shell scripts
  - Is it possible to retrieve the full command from the history by `fc -e : 1`?
